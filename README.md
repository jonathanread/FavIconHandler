# FavIconHandler
Favicon "Handler" for sitefinity, best used in multisite so each site can have their own Favicon. Looks for files in image library for .ico, then files called favicon and adds &lt;link> to &lt;head>

This is best used for multisites that use one master file and many sites. Or allowing the users to control their icon.

Add the project to your solution, add the reference to SitefinityWebApp. Build. Run. Once site has started Go to Administration > Modules and Services > Then install the FavIconHandler
